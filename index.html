        <p>Hey everyone! You can call me Hugo or Marcelo, I'm from Cajamarca, Peru, currently reside in the district of
            Jesus, it is like 12.5 miles of Cajamarca. Some things that I usually enjoy to do are play video-games (my
            favorite one is Plants vs. Zombies), go
            outside and take
            a walk with my dog (its name is Dobby by the way), another thing I really enjoy to do is go to my
            grandmother's place and sit with her and talk, she doesn't have with who to talk, so any time I can, I'll
            visit her so she doesn't feel alone. Also, right now I'm preparing to server for a mission soon! My goal is
            to
            complete the full service to the Lord going the 2 full years wherever he decides to send me, because I know
            that
            it will be
            good not only for me, but for all the persons that I'll be able to teach about the truth and approaching
            them to the
            truth that God has prepared for each of it's sons.
            I'm so excited to start this new path in my life with all of you! And only that, you all can count with me
            with everything
            that you guys need, remember that we are all here learning together</p>
